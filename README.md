# 99Tech Code Challenge

A comprehensive React application showcasing three different coding challenges and solutions, built with modern web technologies.

## 🚀 Features

This application demonstrates three distinct problem-solving approaches:

### 1. Sum to N Solutions

- **Three different algorithms** to calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to N
- **Performance comparison** with execution time measurements
- **Interactive testing** with real-time results
- **Methods included:**
  - Iterative Loop (O(n))
  - Mathematical Formula (O(1)) - Most efficient
  - Recursive Approach (O(n)) - Educational but with limitations

### 2. Currency Swap Interface

- **Real-time cryptocurrency trading** simulation
- **Live price data** from external API
- **Token selection** with visual icons
- **Swap functionality** with amount calculations
- **Responsive design** for different screen sizes

### 3. React Code Analysis

- **Code review** of a provided React component
- **Issue identification** with severity levels (High, Medium, Low)
- **Detailed explanations** of problems found
- **Refactored solutions** for each issue
- **Best practices** recommendations

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend Framework:** React 18 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool:** Vite
- **UI Library:** Mantine v7
- **Icons:** Iconoir React
- **Styling:** CSS-in-JS with Mantine's theming system
- **State Management:** React hooks and local storage
- **Code Quality:** ESLint with TypeScript support
